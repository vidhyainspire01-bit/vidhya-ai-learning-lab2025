Salary Column Summary


Central Tendency

Mean = 288,655

Median = 265,000

Mode = 300,000

Mean > Median, the data is right-skewed 


 Spread

Q1 (25%) = 240,000

Q2 (Median, 50%) = 265,000

Q3 (75%) = 300,000

IQR = 60,000

50% of salaries fall between 240K – 300K.


 Outlier Detection (IQR Method)

Lower Fence = 150,000

Upper Fence = 390,000

Min = 200,000 (above LF → no low outliers)

Max = 940,000 (way above UF → high outliers present)

There are extreme high salaries in the data.

Shape

Skewness = 3.57 (high positive skew) → Most salaries are clustered at the lower end, a few very high earners stretch the tail.

Kurtosis = 18.54 (very high, leptokurtic) → Extremely heavy tails, lots of influence from outliers.



Business Interpretation

The majority of employees earn 240K–300K.

The mean salary (288K) is inflated due to a few very high salaries (~940K).

Salary distribution is highly skewed and leptokurtic, meaning averages are misleading, and median is a better measure of “typical” salary.

Outliers (very high earners) may represent senior executives, star performers, or anomalies and should be studied separately.
